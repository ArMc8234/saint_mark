            br
            p In the year 1906, a group of Christian men and women met at the home of Sister Joanna Wilson.</span></u></strong><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">&nbsp; <strong>The following people were present: &nbsp;Rev. J.T. Jones, Brother Ernest Overby, Vicine Simpson, George Simpson, Thomas Robinson, Horace Robinson, Nonie Darden, J.T. Sweat, Joseph Gilmore, Sister Harriet Vanable, Annie Overby, Jennie Robinson, Alice Hinton, Bettie Pinnick, Mary Ashby, Ada Robinson, Marie Waters and Jophelia Jones.&nbsp;</strong>They met and named the church &ldquo;Saint Mark Christian Church,&rdquo; and their <strong>first pastor was Rev. S. M. Baskerville,</strong> served about three years. &nbsp;The second pastor was <strong>Rev. R.R. Gaines</strong> under whose pastorate the church made rapid progress. &nbsp;<strong>Rev. G.T. Hall</strong> was the next pastor and served during the beginning of WWI. &nbsp; Despite the sadness of war, wages were higher which led to greater resources available for the help of the church.&nbsp;
            br
            p <strong><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">Rev. W.W. Howell</span></strong><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">&nbsp;followed Rev. Hall. &nbsp;He was a very zealous worker and the church acquired new property for worship. After his leaving the church was left without a pastor for some time and was led by several devoted and dedicated church leaders. &nbsp;<strong>Rev. Cherry</strong> was called to fill the vacancy but only served for a short time.</span>
            br
            p <strong><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">Rev. R.R. Gaines</span></strong><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">&nbsp;was recalled to the church during the time of the Great Depression and did not serve very long. &nbsp;<strong>Rev. C.A. Harris</strong> was called as the next pastor. &nbsp;He and his wife, Mary Eliza Harris worked very hard mortgaging their home to pay off the indebtedness of the church. &nbsp;A church clerk was called and several deacons were ordained. &nbsp;Rev. Harris asked the church to accept his suggestion to hire a younger pastor as he was &ldquo;an old man.&rdquo; &nbsp; They accepted his suggestion and he offered the name of Rev. R. J. Alston as the next pastor. &nbsp;The church called <strong>Rev. R. J. Alston</strong> who served for seventeen years. &nbsp;During his administration the church grew financially, physically and spiritually. &nbsp;The church was remodeled and purchased the property in back of it. &nbsp; Rev. Alston was called to another endeavor in New York City in 1952 and left the church.</span>
            br
            p <strong><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">Rev. D. P. Butts</span></strong><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">&nbsp;was called following the departure of Rev. R.J. Alston. &nbsp; He purchased a new organ at the cost of $3,300, as his first project. &nbsp;He also ordained several new deacons with Deacon Bennie Ashby serving as chairman. &nbsp;Deacon William H. Harris also served as chair of the Board of Trustees. <span style="color:red;">&nbsp;</span><strong>During Rev. Butts&rsquo; pastorate, our denomination combined with other denominations to form the United Church of Christ. &nbsp;It then took on the new name of <u>St. Mark United Church of Christ.</u></strong></span>
            br
            p <span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">In January, 1977 the church had to relocate to Metropolitan Funeral Home due to renovation in the Berkley section of Norfolk. &nbsp;They were there until May, 1977. &nbsp;From there the church moved to the old New Hope Church building which had been vacated by its congregation. &nbsp;The church stayed at that location until December, 1978.</span> 
            br
            p <span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">Over several year the church worked tirelessly to build its own church. &nbsp;A contract to build was signed on November, 1975. &nbsp;A building permit was granted in December, 1976 and a groundbreaking ceremony was held. &nbsp;With the Lord&rsquo;s help the members moved into a new church building worth well over $200,00. &nbsp; They marched from New Hope to the new church facility on December 17, 1978. &nbsp;They marched form Berkley Ave., to Mahone Ave., to Obendorfer Rd. where the new church building was located. &nbsp; What a blessing it was to look back and see how far they had come. &nbsp;Giving unto the Lord what was His, the members had a dedication service on April 8 through April 13, 1979. &nbsp;</span>
            br
            p <span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">The church grew with dedicated men and women who gave their time, financial support and spiritual guidance towards the building of God&rsquo;s Kingdom on earth for future generations. &nbsp;Striving to do God&rsquo;s will and continuing to progress, the church called Rev. Randolph Burwell to be assistant pastor to Rev. Butts on March 1, 1982. &nbsp;Rev. Burwell was a blessing to the church family.</span>
            br
            p <span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">Rev. David P. Butts passed away on September 14, 1986 after a long illness. &nbsp;A search committee was formed and after a lengthy search process and with much prayer and fasting, <strong>Rev. Thomas J. Hart</strong> was called to serve as the new pastor. &nbsp; Rev. Hart was presented to the church as the new pastor in October, 1988.</span>
            br
            p <span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">Under Rev. Hart the church continued to grow and prosper. &nbsp; Because of the death of some of the deacons and trustees, Deacons performed the task of helping with the church&rsquo;s financial matters. &nbsp;In 1988 under the leadership of Deacon Charles Boyette the deacons and the church body presented as Julia Avery, Bernice Townes and R.A. Solomon to the congregation for trustees. &nbsp;They were accepted. &nbsp;Julia Avery was elected as Chairperson. &nbsp;In 1991 Rev. Hart and the official board presented James Spruill, Albert Amos, and James Scott as trustees and they were accepted.</span>
            br
            p <span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;">In October, 2019 Rev. Thomas Hart very suddenly and unexpectedly passed away. &nbsp; We mourned his passing and after several months began the pastoral search process. <strong>&nbsp;Rev. Dr. Linda D. T. Clark</strong>, a daughter of the church and former pastor of Union United Church of Christ in Norfolk, was called to the position of Interim Pastor on July 1, 2020. &nbsp;<strong>Dr. Clark is the first woman to serve as pastor in the church&rsquo;s over one-hundred-year history.</strong>&nbsp; She currently serves in this position while leading the congregation to its new pastor.</span>
